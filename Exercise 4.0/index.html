                <p>The Dodge Challenger is the name of three generations of
                    automobiles produced by the American automobile manufacturer
                    Dodge. However, the first use of the Challenger name by
                    Dodge dates back to 1959 for marketing a "value version" of
                    the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger.

                    From model years 1970 to 1974, the first-generation Dodge
                    Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler E platform
                    in hardtop and convertible body styles sharing significant
                    components with the Plymouth Barracuda.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The second generation, from model years 1978 to 1983, was a
                    rebadged Mitsubishi Galant Lambda / Sapporo,[2] a coupe
                    version of an economical compact car.

                    The third and current generation is a full-size muscle car
                    that was introduced in early 2008 initially as a rival to
                    the evolved fifth generation Ford Mustang and the fifth
                    generation Chevrolet Camaro.[3]

                    In November 2021, Stellantis announced that the 2023 model
                    year would be the final model year for both the LD Dodge
                    Charger and LA Dodge Challenger, as the company will focus
                    its plans on electric vehicles rather than fossil
                    fuel-powered vehicles, due to tougher emissions standards
                    required by the Environmental Protection Agency for the 2023
                    model year.[4] Challenger production ended on December 22,
                    2023, and the Brampton, Ontario, assembly plant will be
                    re-tooled to assemble an electrified successor.</p>

                <p class="ex">The E-body Challenger was introduced in the autumn of 1969
                    for the 1970 model year,[6] similar in appearance to but
                    somewhat larger than its less expensive, platform-sharing
                    Plymouth sibling, the Barracuda. It was positioned to
                    compete against the Mercury Cougar and Pontiac Firebird in
                    the upper end of the pony car market,[7] a large and
                    lucrative niche of two-door sport coupes that the Ford
                    Mustang had pioneered in April 1964.[8] Like the Barracuda,
                    it was available in a wide variety of trim and option
                    levels. In spite of its premium price, size, and market
                    placement, Chrysler intended the new Challenger to be the
                    most potent pony car ever,[9] and virtually every engine in
                    its inventory (including the famed 426 Hemi) was made
                    available.[10]

                    While the vehicle was all new, Dodge had used the Challenger
                    name in 1959 for the Silver Challenger, a limited-production
                    two-door coupe based on the fourth-generation Dodge
                    Coronet.The E-body Challenger was introduced in the autumn

                    The 1970 Challenger's longer wheelbase, larger dimensions,
                    and more luxurious interior than the Mustang or its smaller
                    Chrysler products stablemate, the Barracuda, were prompted
                    by the launch of the upscale 1967 Mercury Cougar, a bigger,
                    better appointed, and more expensive pony car aimed at
                    affluent young American buyers.[11] The 110 in (2,800 mm)
                    wheelbase was 2 in (51 mm) longer than the Barracuda's, and
                    the Dodge differed in its sheet metal, much as the Cougar
                    differed from the shorter-wheelbase Mustang. Air
                    conditioning and a rear window defogger were optional.[12]
                    With 1971 being the sole exception, the front ends of both
                    cars differed from each other in that the Challenger had
                    four headlights and the Barracuda had only two.

                    The exterior design was penned by Carl Cameron, who was also
                    responsible for the exterior designs of the 1966 Dodge
                    Charger. Cameron based the 1970 Challenger grille on an
                    older sketch of a stillborn 1966 Charger prototype that was
                    to have a turbine engine. The pony car segment was already
                    declining by the time the Challenger arrived. Sales were
                    excellent initially, with 76,925 units[13] moved in the
                    model's debut year, but fell dramatically after 1970. Though
                    sales rose for the 1973 model year with over 27,800 cars
                    being sold, Challenger production ceased midway through the
                    1974 model year. A total of 165,437 first-generation
                    Challengers were sold.
